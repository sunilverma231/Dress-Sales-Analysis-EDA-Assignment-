# Dress Sales Analysis

Suppose you are working as an analyst at an e-commerce company, and you have been given the following two data sets, which consist of details of women's apparels that have been sold out during the last year:

**Dress Attribute Dataset:** This data set contains the different features of women's apparels.

**Dress Sales Dataset:** This data set contains the number of sales achieved for a particular dress ID on a certain date.

Now, based on the two data sets above, you are expected to perform EDA and draw meaningful insights from the data. Based on the EDA analysis, answer the graded questions.

Dataset is already provided in the folder: 

**Attribute+DataSet.csv**
